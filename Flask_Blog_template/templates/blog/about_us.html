							<p class="desc">Drilers is a platform that solely consists of all the information about talent as well as information about the people who are contributing to making our country proud by their hardwork and struggles. Drilers isn’t a platform that provides information about particular celebrities, or people who have already reached to the pinnacles of success and fame. This platform is for all which includes common people who have an abundance of talent and seeking for a highlight. We bring out the information and spread this information through our different networks so that each citizen of the country should get an update regarding our country’s paramount talent. We are not restricted to only a single field; we will try our best to explore each and every field including sports, business, science, and social activities.</p>
